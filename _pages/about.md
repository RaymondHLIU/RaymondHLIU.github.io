Hao Liu received his Ph.D. degree from the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.ust.hk) in 2017.  He is currently an assistant professor at the Artificial Intelligence Thrust, HKUST (Guangzhou), and an Affiliated Assistant Professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, HKUST (Clear Water Bay).
Dr. Liu's current research interests include urban foundation models, spatiotemporal data mining, and their applications on urban science, intelligent transportation, and recommender systems. 
In the past five years, he has filed over 50 China/U.S. patents and published over 60 research papers at prestigious journals and conferences, such as TKDE, SIGKDD, SIGIR, WebConf, VLDB, NeurIPS, and ICML. For his research on intelligent transportation and urban computing, he was named in Forbes 30 Under 30 China list for science and healthcare 2021.

<!-- After spending several years in industrial research, Hao back to [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)](https://www.ust.hk), where he started his research career.
Previously, Hao was a Research Scientist at Business Intelligence Lab, [Baidu Research](http://research.baidu.com/) and a Postdoctoral Fellow at the HKUST.
Hao received his Ph.D. degree from HKUST in 2017. 
He also received a Bachelor degree from [South China University of Technology](https://www.scut.edu.cn/) in 2012. 
His general research interests are in data mining, machine learning, and big data management, with a special focus on mobile analytics and urban computing.
